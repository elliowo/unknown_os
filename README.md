# unknown_os

This is a hobby os I am developing as a learning project and a challenge. It is called
unknown_os because I do not know what to call it and currently don't know where I will
take it. As of current it is a very basic kernel with a vga_buffer and testing. A 
goal for this project is to make it dependency free but first want to build more 
features for the kernel.
